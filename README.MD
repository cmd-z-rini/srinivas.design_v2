# SRINIVAS ELANG0VAN - Product Design Portfolio

![srinivas-design-v2.vercel.app](assets/images/portfolio-preview.png)

## 🚀 About This Project

This is the source code for my personal design portfolio. As a Product Designer, I believe in bridging the gap between design and engineering.

Instead of using a website builder like Webflow or Framer, I chose to **hand-code** this website from scratch to demonstrate my understanding of front-end development, responsive design, and web accessibility.

🎨 **Design File:** [WILL UPDATE HERE SOON]

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Philosophy

I purposefully avoided heavy frameworks (like React) to focus on the fundamentals of the web.

- **Structure:** Semantic HTML5
- **Styling:** Native CSS (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables)
- **Interactions:** Vanilla JavaScript (No jQuery)
- **Design Tool:** Figma

**Why Manual Code?**
I wanted full control over the micro-interactions and performance. By writing the CSS myself, I ensure that the implementation matches my specific design vision—down to the pixel-perfect border radius and custom SVG paths.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Custom SVG Assets:** Hand-optimized SVGs for the "Speech Bubble" elements to ensure crisp scaling on all devices.
- **Responsive Layout:** A mobile-first approach ensuring the design adapts fluidly from mobile to ultra-wide monitors.
- **Micro-Interactions:** Subtle hover states and scroll-triggered animations to enhance user delight without compromising performance.
- **Clean Codebase:** Organized CSS architecture split by sections (Hero, Header, Footer) for maintainability.
